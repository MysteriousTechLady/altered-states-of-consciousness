If you just want the audio files then find me and I'll send it to you.

if you want the code to create the files, then off you go below:

Pip and Python 3.4+

Check if installed on your operating system:
snippet: where python or where python3 for windows

Perform
pip in your command line interface
You should get a long command list output which means its installed

Then perform:
pip install numpy, scipy

This install the libraries needed for you to create the audio files in .wav format

if AI cannot help you troubleshoot for some reason find me so I can help you.


Happy Bio Hacking!
